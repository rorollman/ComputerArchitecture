# Project: Building a 4-bit Integer ALU
### Objectives
The goal of this exercise is to introduce the process and methodology of designing a new computer circuit from scratch. Using the latest tools the students will learn about hardware descriptive languages and how they are used to build circuits from the micron level.

As a secondary goal, this project will also introduce several languages. The first, Verilog, is a hardware descriptive language that defines the mathematics of the circuit which is used to generate the circuit modules. It also includes a CAD engine for connecting the circuit modules together, circuit validation, voltage, current and heat analysis, waveform generation simulators and an export files that can be sent to a circuit fabricator. It is open source and runs on Linux, with Ubuntu suggested.

The second language is LaTEX which is a document markup language. It is used by most journals as the method for publishing pdf documents. The only acceptable method for making submissions to any IEE or Springer sponsored conference and such is mandatory for any published technical researcher to use. It is a requirement reports for this project be made in LaTEX. The student will need to find an editor/compiler for LaTEX docs, there are plenty of options (TeXstudio for Windows machines is suggested). A LaTEX template will be provided to use with a sample document.

### Step 1: Verilog & LaTEX Basics
* Install Verilog
* Code 1-bit Not, Nand, Nor, and 4-bit Shift Circuit
* Run Circuit Tests and Diagrams
* Generate Simulation Waveforms
* Prepare and submit LaTEX report

### Step 2: ALU Functions
* Code 4-bit Adder
* Code 4-bit Subtraction
* Code 4-bit Multiplier
* Run Circuit Tests and Diagrams
* Generate Simulation Waveforms
* Prepare and submit LaTEX report

### Final: Putting It Together
* Integrate ALU functions
* Code control circuit
* Run Circuit Tests and Diagrams
* Generate Simulation Waveforms
* Export final circuit for fabrication
* Prepare and submit LaTEX report

### Bonus Points: Extra Credit for the Following
* Include division as an ALU function, +5 points on step-2 and final.
* Make the ALU larger, +4 points for 8 bit, +7 for 16, + 10 for 32 on step-2 and final.

### Report Preparation
Every step and the final should have a report done in LaTEX and submitted on the due date. The report should include:
* Header with group name, date, class, and group members.
* Introduction on the project and group goals.
* Section with and explaining Verilog code.
* Section displaying and explaining the circuit diagrams.
* Section sharing test and waveform responses with some explanation.
* Final conclusiong sharing results, perspectives, difficulties, and successes.
